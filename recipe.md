1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can improve my grammar
I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter and ends with a suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark.

2. Design the Function Signature

Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

def grammar_check():
"""Verifies that text passed to it starts with capital letter and ends with a sentence-ending punctuation mark
"""
Parameters:
"""A string text to be checked""""

Returns:
"""A messaged to indicate if everything is grammatically correct, indicates any grammatically incorrect sentences."""

Side effects:
"""None so far"""


3. Create Examples as Tests

Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return.




Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.

4. Implement the Behaviour

After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
